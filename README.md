# MeleeWebscraper

A webscraper that scrapes https://www.ssbwiki.com in order to get tournament results.

## How to use
Run webscraper.py to generate the results of the tournaments in `tournamentResults.txt`. At this point you can run `generateColor.py` and `generateColorCharacter.py` which generates `color.txt` and `characters.txt` respectively. This is consumed [here](https://github.com/luohoward/MeleeResults/tree/master/src/assets)
